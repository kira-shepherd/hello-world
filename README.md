As a UX/UI designer, I've been learning to code to bring my design visions to life more effectively. Coding has given me a deeper understanding of the interplay between design and functionality. Through self-study, I've delved into front-end web development languages like HTML and CSS. Bridging the gap between design and development has opened up new creative possibilities. I'm excited to continue exploring the intersection of aesthetics and technology to craft immersive digital experiences.
